Osayamen Jonathan Aimuyo is a computer science researcher interested in distributed and parallel computing systems
and algorithms; specifically, he seeks to address computational and communication bottlenecks in
large-scale machine learning execution on accelerators.
He earned a BS in computer engineering, \textit{summa cum laude}, with Tau Beta Pi and Phi Kappa Phi Honors from the
University of Texas at Dallas (class of 2023),
where he was a Presidential Achievement Scholar and a semifinalist
for the national Jack Kent Cooke Transfer Scholarship (2019).
He is currently a second-year CS MS student at Cornell University,
advised by Dr. Rachee Singh.
In industry, he contributed to large-scale distributed systems through internships at
Microsoft (\('22\) - \('24\)), Chime Financial ('22), and JPMorgan Chase (\('20\) - \('21\)).
Upon graduating from Cornell, he will intern at NVIDIA with the CUDA Math Libraries team,
before commencing his Computer Science PhD at Stanford University in Autumn 2025, where his research
would be supported by the \textbf{NSF GRFP} (2025) fellowship.
