Osayamen Jonathan Aimuyo is a computer science researcher who develops systems and algorithms that address distributed
and parallel computing performance bottlenecks.
His work thus far focuses on systems optimizations for large-scale machine learning training and inference.
Jonathan earned a BS in computer engineering, \textit{summa cum laude}, with Tau Beta Pi and Phi Kappa Phi Honors from the
University of Texas at Dallas (class of 2023),
where he was a Presidential Achievement Scholar and a semifinalist
for the national Jack Kent Cooke Transfer Scholarship (2019).
He is currently a second-year CS MS student at Cornell University,
advised by Dr. Rachee Singh.
While at Cornell, he received an Honorable Mention recognition for the
\textbf{N}ational \textbf{S}cience \textbf{F}oundation \textbf{G}raduate \textbf{R}esearch \textbf{F}ellowships
\textbf{P}rogram (NSF GRFP 2025).
He has built large-scale distributed systems within the industry
via internships at Microsoft ('24, \('23\), \('22\)), Chime Financial ('22), and JPMorgan Chase ('21, \('20\)).
Post graduation from Cornell, he will intern at NVIDIA with the CUDA Math Libraries team,
after which he will start his computer science PhD at Stanford University in Fall 2025.
