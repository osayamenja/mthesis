His work focuses on systems-level optimizations for large-scale machine learning training and inference.
His work thus far focuses on systems optimizations for large-scale machine learning training and inference.
Jonathan earned a BS in computer engineering, \textit{summa cum laude}, with Tau Beta Pi and Phi Kappa Phi Honors from the
University of Texas at Dallas (class of 2023),
where he was a Presidential Achievement Scholar and a semifinalist
for the national Jack Kent Cooke Transfer Scholarship (2019).
He is currently a second-year CS MS student at Cornell University,
advised by Dr. Rachee Singh.
While at Cornell, he received an Honorable Mention recognition for the
\textbf{N}ational \textbf{S}cience \textbf{F}oundation \textbf{G}raduate \textbf{R}esearch \textbf{F}ellowships
\textbf{P}rogram (NSF GRFP 2025).
In industry, he has contributed to large-scale distributed systems through internships at
Microsoft (\('22\) - \('24\)), Chime Financial ('22), and JPMorgan Chase (\('20\) - \('21\)).
After graduating from Cornell, he will intern at NVIDIA with the CUDA Math Libraries team,
before beginning his PhD in Computer Science at Stanford University in Fall 2025.
