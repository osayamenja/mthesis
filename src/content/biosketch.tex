Osayamen Jonathan Aimuyo is a computer science researcher specializing in distributed and parallel computing systems
and algorithms.
His work focuses on low-level optimizations for computational and communication bottlenecks in
large-scale machine learning training and inference on accelerators.
Jonathan earned a BS in computer engineering, \textit{summa cum laude}, with Tau Beta Pi and Phi Kappa Phi Honors from the
University of Texas at Dallas (class of 2023),
where he was a Presidential Achievement Scholar and a semifinalist
for the national Jack Kent Cooke Transfer Scholarship (2019).
He is currently a second-year CS MS student at Cornell University,
advised by Dr. Rachee Singh.
In industry, he has contributed to large-scale distributed systems through internships at
Microsoft (\('22\) - \('24\)), Chime Financial ('22), and JPMorgan Chase (\('20\) - \('21\)).
After graduating from Cornell, he will intern at NVIDIA with the CUDA Math Libraries team,
before beginning his PhD in Computer Science at Stanford University in Fall 2025, where his research
would be supported by the \textbf{NSF GRFP} fellowship.
