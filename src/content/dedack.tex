    First and foremost, I thank God—the Author of all things good—for sustaining me through every moment of this journey.
    He remained faithful in seasons of clarity and in the shadows of doubt.
    The merit this work holds is but a fragment of the grace I have received.

    To my amazing advisor, \textbf{Dr. Rachee Singh}, \emph{thank you} for the trust, the freedom, and the support.
    For giving me the space to think outside the box and for being an excellent mentor and overall incredibly generous
    person.
    I am grateful for your supervision and your unique willingness to support your students to no end,
    ensuring that they succeed in blossoming as well-rounded researchers.
    I am also very appreciative of the lab equipment (GPUs) you made readily accessible to me and our lab.
    I did most of the preliminary exploration and hypothesis testing for this thesis research on those GPUs,
    and I acknowledge they contributed immense value to my work.

    To my minor field member, \textbf{Dr. Giulia Guidi}, I thank you for being an excellent mentor,
    incredibly generous with your time, and for providing
    me with access to high-performance supercomputing resources.
    I made excellent use of this computing infrastructure for this research,
    and I am well aware of the privilege of using them for my work.

    To my second minor field member, \textbf{Dr. Chris De Sa}, I am very grateful to have had the privilege of learning
    about Machine Learning Systems (MLSys) from you!
    Your enthusiasm and passion for the field are highly encouraging.
    In addition, you are an excellent teacher.
    I wish I could retake your MLSys class!

    I would also like to acknowledge the Christ Chapel community and Choir ('24/25 semester) for being my second family outside
    my biological family.
    I joined you all without knowing how to read sheet music, yet you welcomed me and gave me the space to grow rapidly.
    I am incredibly grateful for this kindness, which made me the slightly more competent musician and
    vocalist I am today.
    I am specifically grateful to Dr. Art Ostrander (Choir Director);
    Carrie Ostrander (Soprano); Dr. Debbie Martin (Alto and pianist); Jyying Juliana Kan (Soprano);
    Margaret Brodhead (Pianist); Jim and Cindy Van Duren (Bass and Soprano);
    Amy Blumenthal (Alto); Debbie Axtell (Alto); and Lawrence and Wendy Lyon.

    I would be remiss not to mention my colleagues at Cornell who made my time memorable: the CS MS class of
    \('24\) and \('25\), Dr. Singh's group, Julian Bellavita and the systems research group.

    Finally, I want to acknowledge my parents, whose instrumental support has played an immeasurable role in my academic
    endeavors, thank you.
