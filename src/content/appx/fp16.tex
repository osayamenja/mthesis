    \caption{Here, we report the total GPU memory throughput for both FP16 (top) and FP32 (bottom) variants of \sysname.
    Notably, the FP16 implementation issues approximately $2\times$
        more shared memory instructions compared to its FP32 counterpart
        under identical workloads.
        We attribute this inefficiency to
        suboptimal shared memory layouts in \sysname when
        operating on half-precision data.
        While this bottleneck is addressable through improved layout strategies,
        we leave its resolution to future work due to time constraints.}
